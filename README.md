# Welcome
This repository contains the code and data to replicate our upcoming paper on measuring the connectivity of a cycling network using discontinuity indicators.

* End of a cycling facility

* Change of a cycling facility type



# Required Software

* spatialite (optional spatialite_gui)
* text editor (e.g. Notepad++)

# Required Datasets

* Cycling network shapefile (this shapefile should have a field named facilities with the different cycling facility types)
* The cycling network in this example has already been categorized into three facility types:

1.	Separate cycling facility
2.	Painted bike lane
3.	Off-road cycling facility

# Step-by-step guide
